|Competition format|For each category there will, depending on numbers, be one or two rounds of pools for all fencers  followed by a Direct Elimination.<br/><br/>Novices and Intermediates will fence together in one competition at least in the pools, but separate medals/trophies will be given for both.<br/><br/>Normally all fencers can expect to be included in the DE, but if numbers are large there may have to be a cut, but only if two rounds of pools are fought. The format will be described on the day.<br/><br/>If ladies or men's numbers are low, then ladies and men may be given the option of fencing the pools (but not the DE) together.<br/><br/>No fence off for 3rd place.|
